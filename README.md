# Welcome to MY-SITE API Sample Project

# Note:

*You will find two contributors, two emails are for me cehceh(amr.jobmail@gmail.com) with my private email and amrammer(amr.ali@tuftstudios.com) with tuft studios email*
*The reason for that because on my machine I ran (git config --global user.email) for this email(amr.ali@tuftstudios.com) and forgot to do the same action for the main one(amr.jobmail@gmail.com)*


 *Here is a brief about it*

# 1- First you can find requirements.txt and run files beside manage.py file 

  - "run" file is for making our life easier, you can run the project by using it with the next 
    command on the linux terminal (#$ source run)
    But after change the file paths and change the environment name (or you can use my env and paths name)
  
# 2- Second please let me talk about the (3) tasks.
  *In general your tasks are good and easy to accomplish, and I must mention that to be honest*

  *But there are some difficulties faced me when I began to achieve the third task and also with testing*

  *Testing is one of the most important topics in Django that I try to penetrate it by reading books like (Test Driven Development with python) and with some good tutorials, but till now I'm struggling with it. Really I'm trying to be good in it but till now it's annoying me.*
  - Update for the testing issue, The problem was in ("avatar field") it's an image field so we must use 
  - (Base64ImageField) as mentioned here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28036404/django-rest-framework-upload-image-the-submitted-data-was-not-a-file)  

  *Also API with DRF I'm struggling with it, In fact I read the(Django for APIs)book by William S. Vincent in 10 days,*
  *Really it gives me an outline about the APIs terminology, but it's far from real Django REST Framework.*
  *So, DRF needs practical work besides reading, Thanks to Tuft Studios company that enabled me to achieve your tasks by working for 10 months on practical mobile app. with Django DRF.*

  - Task (1): I think the job has been done as you want or near you want.

  - Task (2): Also the job has been done as you want.

  - Task (3): The job has been done, But I think there is something wrong 

  - Testing : I don't know what can I say, you can find 3 files (the good one is test_models) and the others are work only with HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, it takes a lot of time to fix issues (one issue solved another raised).

  - Using django-environ to secure my sensitive data (it's a good package)

  - Books which I open and not finish them (Test Driven Development with python), (Designing Microservices with Django), (Designing Data Intensive Application) and (High Performance Django).

  - Many tries to fix issues in task(3) and tests but till now I think task(3) may be not bad or I understood your task wrong. Anyway, I did my best as possible as I can to solve the issue.  

  - Finally I'm trying to enhance my knowledge. So I'm learning (Data Structure and algorithms) and (Design Patterns in Python) But the learning process takes some times to absorb the scientific material. But I'm hungry to learn more. 
  


# Thanks for reading .....
